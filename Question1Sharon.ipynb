However, the lower test r-squared compared to the training r-squared suggests a potential issue with overfitting. Furthermore, the mean squared error (MSE) of the test data is higher than that of the training data. While this basic linear regression model shows an understandable performance for a baseline model, I will be exploring more sophisticated models will provide insights into potential improvements."

    "From the above sections, you will notice that I have tried with and without the selected features. The reason for this is becuase, I talked to professor GS, multiple TA's, removed countries, tried different SFS paramaters and suprisingly the features selected values made my models perform worse.So for the sake of my model, I will be using data that is not using feature selection. However, for the dataframe has all the values to take into consideration.\n",

    "#### Result: \n",
    "None of the models performed well with the selected features suprisingly. But from all of them Ridge performed the best despite slight overfitting. The RF's MSE is exceptionally low which is great and has a descent R squared Train of 0.94 and R squared test of 0.65.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, Ridge regression appears to be the most robust model among the ones tested, with consistent performance regardless of feature selection. Random Forest performs exceptionally well without feature selection but suffers from poor performance when selected features are used. Linear regression and ElasticNet exhibit similar behavior, with poor performance when selected features are included. Overall, the models' performance suggests that feature selection might not be beneficial in this context, I will be moving forward with Random Forrest regression as the most reliable choice for modeling the data."

    "#### Observations:\n",
    "For Linear Regression ,the model seems to have a moderate fit to the training data but performs similarly on the test data, indicating no significant overfitting. However, the R-squared values shows that the model explains only about 20% of the variance in the data which does not capture the complexity of the relationship between predictors and the target variable well.\n",
    "For my Ridge model, using hyperparameter tuning, the performance did not improve significantly. The model still exhibits similar performance to the linear regression model, with slightly better R-squared values but higher MSE values. This suggests that the regularization introduced by Ridge regression doesn't greatly benefit the model in this case.\n",
    "The Random Forest model performs really well on the training data, achieving a very high R-squared value and low MSE. However, when hypertuned the values for R and MSE somehow got worse. \n",
    "The ElasticNet model performs similarly to the linear regression and Ridge regression models, with low R-squared values and relatively high MSE values. Despite using both L1 and L2 regularization, the model fails to improve performance significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Results:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Random Forest model appears to perform the best on the training data, achieving a high R-squared value and low MSE. However, due to the drop in performance on the test data, it may mean that it suffers from overfitting. However, taking into consideration as this model performs relativly the best as compared to the other models, as a data analyst I would choose RF as my model of choice when addressing this question as it shows the most promise if we took a better look into the data and refinement.\n"

    "## Conclusions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding my question which addresses the relationship between socio-economic factors and the share of female STEM graduates over time, the models' relatively low performance shows that the selected predictors may not adequately capture the complexity of this relationship. On further analysis, it may be possible that there are limitations of the dataset when it comes to my question. For the future, I would possibly include additional predictors or exploring alternative modeling approaches, which would capture underlying factors to understand and predict future trends in female STEM participation like variables related to educational policies, cultural attitudes towards women in STEM.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you look at the feature Importance it shows that GDP and rural population play an important role as socio economic factors. GDP being of high importance suggests that economic prosperity plays a significant role in shaping opportunities for women in STEM. Countries with higher GDP may have more resources allocated to education, infrastructure, and research, thereby facilitating greater participation of women in STEM fields. Additionally, higher GDP may correlate with greater societal openness and inclusivity, which can encourage women to pursue careers in traditionally male-dominated fields like STEM. For Rural population, rural areas often face unique challenges such as limited access to educational resources, infrastructure, and job opportunities. Women in rural areas may encounter additional barriers to accessing STEM education and career pathways compared to their urban counterparts. Addressing the needs of rural communities is essential for promoting gender diversity in STEM fields. Finally, the importance of school enrollment underscores the importance of early education in fostering interest and participation in STEM among women. Higher rates of school enrollment, especially in STEM-related fields, indicate a positive trajectory for increasing the representation of women in STEM. Efforts to improve access to quality education, promote STEM awareness, and provide supportive learning environments can contribute to narrowing the gender gap in STEM enrollment and graduation rates."
